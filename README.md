There were 38% of the views that were 5 stars and 54% non-vine review that were 5 stars. 


## Summary 

I do not see any positive bias for review in the Vine program. There are only 170 Vine review among total votes.

which as it shows its only 0.09% of 5 star reveiws among the votes. 

On the other hand, Non-vine program reviews are 20612 5 star-reviews with 37840 total non-vine reveiws. Which is 54% of the whole un_paid reviews. 
Which is significantly higher than the 5-star vine reviews (38%)

I would say the Vine program is not worth of the fees paid for the pet product company that was analzied.
